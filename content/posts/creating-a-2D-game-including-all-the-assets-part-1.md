Lately I've been very interested in drawing but lacked the content of what to draw, I was drawing some random geometric shapes, fruits and doodles, but I wanted something more meaningful, so I had the idea to do something that I always enjoy doing, create a multiplayer game. I've made plenty of games in my life, but always I relied on third-party assets, so this would be perfect, I would to get to draw a lot while making a game. I always liked that old school open-world RPG games like pokemon and it is one of those that I'm gonna aim for, here's how it has been going so far.

After watching lots of videos about drawing 2D games I decided to start with some grass tiles, I created a 128x128 file and started sketching. It quickly become apparent that it would be much harder than I thought and also made me realize that 128x128 would be too big for my project, I switched to 32x32 and it became much easier.

But after studying a bit more, I'll probably redraw that in 16x16, which will be even easier as a first project.

Now I needed to draw the main character before putting everything in the game, for the character I started 16x16 right away. Drawing it in a single pose wasn't too bad (althought it is very simple):

But animation was another story, I decided to just switch the legs as a bare minimum animation just to see how it will look in the game.

And this is how the game is looking so far (image quality is terrible):

This is being a lot of fun, I'll continue to work on it and see how far it goes.
